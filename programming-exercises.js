// Baseball Teams
// A group of kids wants to play baseball. To select teams, they stand in a circle and recite a
// rhyme. They go around the circle and each kid calls out the next word of the rhyme. The child
// who calls out the last word of the rhyme leaves the circle to join Team 1. This repeats until the
// teams are equal, at which point the remaining kids in the circle form Team 2.
// Write some code to implement this method of selecting teams, given a list (L) of kidsâ€™ names
// which represents the order of the children in the circle (assume the length of L is even) and a
// rhyme of length W.
